        New technologies arrive every day.
        This is why I believe that the most important skill a software developer can have today is the ability to learn new things quickly and efficiently.
        I make sure to stay updated with all the new stuff that get released and experience as much and I can.
        My goal is to learn at least one new thing every day.`,
